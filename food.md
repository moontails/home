## yogurt pot in pot

1. use the wire rack with some (1 cup) of water and
2. place the milk in a clean glass bowl (clean lid/change sealing ring as needed)
3. set it to "Steam" mode for 1 minutes with vent in sealing position.
4. remove the yogurt culture and keep it at room temperature.
5. release the pressure naturally.
6. open instant pot to cool down the milk to about 110°F or 43°C or lukewarm when tip of finger inserted.
7. mix the culture and start the `yogurt` mode (default 8 hours - exp as needed)

notes
- sanitize by `steaming` lemon juice with 2 cups of water for a minute or so (during heavy direct use)
- have the yogurt culture at room temperature when you are ready to mix (temperature when you mix is very important)
- delaying refrigeration can cause souring
